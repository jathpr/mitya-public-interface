The optimal solution seemed to me to find the system that helps me understand the direction. \nLeaving a way to go. \nI think there are many such systems in the world. \n(Will and happiness) As a result, any system can only suggest things, and your personal path plays the main role. \nIn this section, I plan to gradually talk about the system I rely on. \nAnd I am infinitely grateful to all those people through whom it exists",
